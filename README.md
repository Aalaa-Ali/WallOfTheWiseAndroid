Wall of the Wise
====================

This project is a port of a Java Swing application to Android. The original Swing application can be found here http://appjangle.com/showcase#javaClient

This is a demo application that lists the number of posts each Avatar (user name) has made on a wall (specified by a URL). The output is automatically updated if new posts are made to the wall.

There are three example URLs to choose from, or a custom URL can be entered.

An example output post count is shown below.
